Introduction
############

geonum is a python library for geographic calculations and provides
intuitive tools for representing locations on Earth in terms of longitude,
latitude and altitude and associated arithmetics. For instance, geonum
provides features for distance or heading retrievals, or to compute
intersections of different viewing directions (e.g. intersection of a camera
viewing direction with some topographic feature, such as a mountain in a
scene). In addition, geonum provides high-level tools to represent
geographic domains, and to retrieve and process topographic data within them.

geonum was developed together with the `pyplis <https://pyplis.readthedocs
.io/en/latest/>`_ library
(python plume imaging software) to provide the required tools to derive the
required measurement geometry (e.g., distance of camera to volcanic emission
plume, see e.g. `Gliss et al., 2017, Figure 3 therein <https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/7/4/134/htm>`__).
